# HR-Analytics---Employee-Churn

Tools Used: SAS, R, Tableau, Excel

Presided extensive data analysis and predictive modeling to develop a robust employee turnover model, resulting in predicting employee departures. Identified gaps and recommended salary increases for high performing employees, increase in employee retention.

Dataset: Employee.csv

I tried explaining all insights, visualizations, and findings in presentations and project reports that have been uploaded. Tableau files are not being uploaded. Please see the project report for a detailed explanation of the approach to problem solving.

The R studio code used to obtain the prediction values is included in the '.R' files that were uploaded.

The "prediction results.csv" files contain the final test data results.

I am sure the results can be improved and i am working on it. Thank you.
